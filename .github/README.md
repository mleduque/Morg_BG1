# Morg NPC for BG1:EE

This is a mod made for Baldur's Gate 1: Enhanced Edition. It adds a new companion called **Morg, in a dungeon in the first Cloakwood area (AR2200)**. An abandoned well works as an entrance to the dungeon. You can find the well entrance on the eastern edge of the map. Just go down when you first enter the area in chapter 3.

The content of this mod has been made with the hope of it not being intrusive to normal vanilla playthroughs, the item powerlevels have been designed as to not overpower anything in the base Enhanced Edition. The same goes for the design of the NPC Morg, he has no interactions with the world beoynd recruiting him as of now.

## How to install?

Morg NPC has been made with the help of WeiDU. Unzip the folder to your Baldur's Gate 1:EE install directory. After unzipping there should be a `setup-k4morgul.exe` program. Run the program and you should be queried if you wish to install the mod. Run the same program if you wan to uninstall the mod.

## Who is Morg?
![Portrait of Morg](morg_face.png?raw=true)

Morg is a Lawful Evil Dwarven (Duergar) **Fighter/Necromancer**. Because of his Duergar race, he can cast invisibility as an innate ability. He does not have any banters yet, as I'm not sure how to do quality ones with the BioWare NPC's as it's impossible to do new voicelines for them.

### Enemies in the dungeon

The dungeon contains three groups of enemies. Enemy spell order and usage might throw you off if you are used to vanilla spellcasters.

+ Faere Tor'Sszafin, a drow priestess with a bunch of spiders. If you can't get past her, come back later.
+ Xathan Tor'Sszafin, a drow fighter/mage, along with the Duergar captain Ilpo, they have a lot of other Duergars helping them. This fight might give you trouble as Xathan is pretty careless with fireballs.
+ A duergar search party led by Lokir.

+ All assets were made utilizing **Ableton Live 10**, **Audacity**, **GIMP** and **Blender**.
