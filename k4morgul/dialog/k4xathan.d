//~Ilpo, I'm incredibly depressed by our current state of affairs. It looks like you have failed, again. Eyes of a surface dweller gaze upon us.~
//== ~k4duecap~ ~By me grey beard! Wouldst ye like me to wipe yer soft bottom cheeks?~
//== ~k4xathan~ ~No, I know very well our contract does not require you to deal with excrament.~
//== ~k4duecap~ ~Ye bloody right it doesn't.~
//== ~k4xathan~ ~However, much to your short delight, the contract obliges you to kill anything that so much as looks at me.~
//== ~k4duecap~ ~I can't bloody dig us out and kill things at the same time now, can I? So what is it?~
//== ~k4xathan~ ~Consider the order of digging us out without breaks altered. Now help me get rid of these ugly creatures.~
//== ~k4duecap~ ~Ya heard it boys? Time to take a killing break!~
